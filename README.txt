## üöÄ Features
- **Fully Responsive:** Looks great on any device, with a mobile-optimized navbar.

- **Gallery:** Scrollable image gallery with modern UI.
- **Education & Achievements:** Timeline/list of academic and extracurricular highlights.
- **Text Analyzer:** Tool to count words, letters, and more.
- **Downloadable CV:** Easily accessible resume.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack
- HTML5, CSS3 (with custom properties), JavaScript (vanilla)
- No frameworks or build tools required

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Text Analyzer Assumptions

- **Pronouns:** The tool uses a standard list of English pronouns, including personal, possessive, reflexive, demonstrative, relative, and interrogative forms (e.g., "I", "me", "my", "ourselves", "who", "which").
- **Prepositions:** The tool uses a common list of English prepositions. "but" is included, as it can act as a preposition in some contexts (e.g., "everyone but me"), though it is more commonly a conjunction.
- **Articles:** Only "a" and "an" are counted as articles ("the" is not included).
- **Word counting:** Words are counted using word boundaries (\b\w+\b), so contractions and hyphenated words may be treated as separate words.
- **Letter counting:** Only alphabetic characters (A-Z, a-z) are counted as letters.
- **Whitespace:** Spaces and newlines are counted separately.

## üìù Customization
- Update content in the HTML files as needed.
- Replace images in the `images/` and `icons/` folders.
- Tweak colors in `:root` of `style.css` for your own palette.
- To change the background animation, edit or replace `matrix-bg.js`.
